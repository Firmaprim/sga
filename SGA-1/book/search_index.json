This is an immersion, and thus a closed immersion of X into an open subset V of X\\times_Y X. Let {\\mathscr{I}}_X be the ideal of the closed sub-prescheme corresponding to the diagonal in V (N.B. if one really wishes to do things intrinsically, without assuming that X is separated over Y — a misleading hypothesis — then one should consider the set-theoretic inverse image of {\\mathcal{O}}_{X\\times X} in X and denote by {\\mathscr{I}}_X the augmentation ideal in the above ). The sheaf {\\mathscr{I}}_X/{\\mathscr{I}}_X^2 can be thought of as a quasi-coherent sheaf on X, which we denote by \\Omega_{X/Y}^1. This sheaf is of finite type if X\\to Y is of finite type, and it behaves well with respect to a base change Y'\\to Y. We also introduce the sheaves {\\mathcal{O}}_{X\\times_Y X}/{\\mathscr{I}}_X^{n+1}={\\mathscr{P}}^n_{X/Y}, which are sheaves of on X, giving us preschemes denoted by \\Delta_{X/Y}^n and called the . The polysyllogism is entirely trivial, even if rather long1; it seems wise to not discuss it until we use it for something helpful, with smooth morphisms. 1.2 Quasi-finite morphisms cf. EGA IV 16.3.↩︎ "]]
