\begin{itenv}{Proposition 7.1}
\label{I.7.1}
  Let $A$ be a Noetherian ring, $B$ an algebra which is finite over $A$, $u$ a generator of $B$ over $A$, and $F\in A[t]$ such that $F(u)=0$ (we do not assume $F$ to be monic).
  Let $u'=F'(u)$ (where $F'$ is the differentiated polynomial), $\frak{q}$ a prime ideal of $B$ not containing $u'$, and $\frak{p}$ its intersection with $A$.
  Then $B_\frak{q}$ is unramified over $A_\frak{p}$.
\end{itenv}

In other words, taking $Y=\Spec(A)$, $X=\Spec(B)$, and $X_{u'}=\Spec(B_{u'})$, we claim that $X_{u'}$ is unramified over $Y$.
This statement follows from the following, more precise:

\begin{itenv}{Corollary 7.2}
\label{I.7.2}
  The different ideal of $B/A$ contains $u'B$, and is equal to $u'B$ if the natural homomorphism $A[t]/FA[t]\to B$ (sending $t$ to $u$) is an isomorphism.
\end{itenv}

\begin{proof}
  Let
