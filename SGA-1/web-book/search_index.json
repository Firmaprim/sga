Étale morphisms To simplify the exposition, we assume that all preschemes in the following are locally Noetherian (at least, starting from §2). 1. Basics of differential calculus Let X be a prescheme on Y, and \\Delta_{X/Y} the diagonal morphism X\\to X\\times_Y X. This is an immersion, and thus a closed immersion of X into an open subset V of X\\times_Y X. Let {\\mathscr{I}}_X be the ideal of the closed sub-prescheme corresponding to the diagonal in V (N.B. if one really wishes to do things intrinsically, without assuming that X is separated over Y — a misleading hypothesis — then one should consider the set-theoretic inverse image of {\\mathcal{O}}_{X\\times X} in X and denote by {\\mathscr{I}}_X the augmentation ideal in the above ). The sheaf {\\mathscr{I}}_X/{\\mathscr{I}}_X^2 can be thought of as a quasi-coherent sheaf on X, which we denote by \\Omega_{X/Y}^1. This sheaf is of finite type if X\\to Y is of finite type, and it behaves well with respect to a base change Y'\\to Y. We also introduce the sheaves {\\mathcal{O}}_{X\\times_Y X}/{\\mathscr{I}}_X^{n+1}={\\mathscr{P}}^n_{X/Y}, which are sheaves of rings on X, giving us preschemes denoted by \\Delta_{X/Y}^n and called the n-th infinitesimal neighbourhood of X/Y. The polysyllogism is entirely trivial, even if rather long1; it seems wise to not discuss it until we use it for something helpful, with smooth morphisms. 2. Quasi-finite morphisms (#prp:I.2.1) Let A\\to B be a local homomorphism (N.B. all rings are now Noetherian) and {\\mathfrak{m}} the maximal ideal of A. Then the following conditions are equivalent: B/{\\mathfrak{m}}B is of finite dimension over k=A/{\\mathfrak{m}}. {\\mathfrak{m}}B is an ideal of definition, and B/{\\mathfrak{r}}(B)=k(B) is an extension of k=k(A). The completion \\widehat{B} of B is finite over the completion \\widehat{A} of A. We then say that B is quasi-finite over A. A morphism f\\colon X\\to Y is said to be quasi-finite at x (or the Y-prescheme f is said to be quasi-finite at x) if {\\mathcal{O}}_x is quasi-finite over {\\mathcal{O}}_{f(x)}. This is equivalent to saying that x is isolated in its fibre f^{-1}(x). A morphism is said to be quasi-finite if it is quasi-finite at each point2. (#cor:I.2.2) If A is complete, then quasi-finiteness is equivalent to finiteness. We could also give the usual polysyllogism (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) for quasi-finite morphisms, but that doesn’t seem necessary here. 3. Unramified morphisms (#prp:I.3.1) Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism of finite type, x\\in X, and y=f(x). Then the following conditions are equivalent: {\\mathcal{O}}_x/{\\mathfrak{m}}_y{\\mathcal{O}}_x is a finite separable extension of k(y). \\Omega_{X/Y}^1 is zero at x. The diagonal morphism \\Delta_{X/Y} is an open immersion on a neighbourhood of x. Proof. For the implication (i) \\implies (ii), we can use Nakayama to reduce to the case where Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(k) and X=\\operatorname{Spec}(k'), where it is well known, and also trivial by the definition of separable; (ii) \\implies (iii) comes from a nice and easy characterisation of open immersions, using Krull; (iii) \\implies (i) follows as well from reducing to the case where Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(k) and the diagonal morphism is everywhere an open immersion. We must then prove that X is finite with separable ring over k, and this leads us to consider the case where k is algebraically closed. But then every closed point of X is isolated (since it is identical to the inverse image of the diagonal by the morphism X\\to X\\times_k X defined by x), whence X is finite. We can thus suppose that X consists of a single point, with ring A, and so A\\otimes_k A\\to A is an isomorphism, hence A=k. (#def:I.3.2) — Let f satisfy one of the equivalent conditions of 3.1. We then say that f is unramified at x, or that X is unramified at x on Y. Let A\\to B be a local homomorphism. We say that it is unramified, or that B is a local unramified algebra on A, if B/{\\mathfrak{r}}(A)B is a finite separable extension of A/{\\mathfrak{r}}(A), i.e. if {\\mathfrak{r}}(A)B={\\mathfrak{r}}(B) and k(B) is a separable extension of k(A).3 Remark. The fact that B is unramified over A can be seen at the level of the completions of A and B. Unramified implies quasi-finite. (#cor:I.3.3) The set of points where f is unramified is open. (#cor:I.3.4) Let X' and X be preschemes of finite type over Y, and g\\colon X'\\to X a Y-morphism. If X is unramified over Y, then the graph morphism \\Gamma_g\\colon X'\\to X\\times_Y X is an open immersion. Indeed, this is the inverse image of the diagonal morphism X\\to X\\times_Y X by g\\times_Y \\mathrm{id}_{X'}\\colon X'\\times_Y X\\to X\\times_Y X. One can also introduce the annihilator ideal {\\mathfrak{d}}_{X/Y} of \\Omega_{X/Y}^1, called the different ideal of X/Y; it defines a closed sub-prescheme of X which, set-theoretically, is the set of point where X/Y is ramified, i.e. not unramified. (#prp:I.3.5) — An immersion is ramified. The composition of two ramified morphisms is also ramified. Base extension of a ramified morphisms is also ramified. We are rather indifferent about (ii) and (iii) (the second seems more interesting to me). We can, of course, also be more precise, by giving some one-off statements; this is more general only in appearance (except for in the case of definition (b)), and is boring. We obtain, as per usual, the corollaries: (#cor:I.3.6) — The cartesian product of two unramified morphisms is unramified. If gf is unramified then so too is f. If f is unramified then so too is f_\\text{red}. (#prp:I.3.7) Let A\\to B be a local homomorphism, and suppose that the residue extension k(B)/k(A) is trivial, with k(A) algebraically closed. In order for B/A to be unramified, it is necessary and sufficient that \\widehat{B} be (as an \\widehat{A}-algebra) a quotient of \\widehat{A}. Remark. — In the case where we don’t suppose that the residue extension is trivial, we can reduce to the case where it is by taking a suitable finite flat extension of A which destroys the aforementioned extension. Consider the example where A is the local ring of an ordinary double point of a curve, and B a point of its normalisation: then A\\subset B, B is unramified over A with trivial residue extension, and \\widehat{A}\\to\\widehat{B} is surjective but not injective. We are thus going to strengthen the notion of unramified-ness. 4. Étale morphisms. Étale coverings We are going to suppose that everything concerning flat morphisms that we need to be true is indeed true; these facts will be proved later, if there is time4. (#def:I.4.1) — Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism of finite type. We say that f is étale at x if f is both flat and unramified at x. We say that f is étale if it is étale at all points. We say that X is étale at x over Y, or that it is a Y-prescheme which is étale at x etc. Let f\\colon A\\to B be a local homomorphism. We say that f is étale, or that B is étale over A, if B is flat and unramified over A.5 (#prp:I.4.2) For B/A to be étale, it is necessary and sufficient that \\widehat{B}/\\widehat{A} be étale. Proof. This is true individually for both “unramified” and “flat”. (#cor:I.4.3) Let f\\colon X\\to Y be of finite type, and x\\in X. The property of f being étale at x depends only on the local homomorphism {\\mathcal{O}}_{f(x)}\\to{\\mathcal{O}}_x, and in fact only on the corresponding homomorphism for the completions. (#cor:I.4.4) Suppose that the residue extension k(A)\\to k(B) is trivial, or that k(A) is algebraically closed. Then B/A is étale if and only if \\widehat{A}\\to\\widehat{B} is an isomorphism. We can combine flatness with 3.7. (#prp:I.4.5) Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism of finite type. Then the set of points where f is étale is open. Proof. Again, this is true individually for both “unramified” and “flat”. This proposition shows that we can forget about the “one-off” comments in the study of morphisms of finite type that are somewhere étale. (#prp:I.4.6) — An open immersion is étale. The composition of two étale morphisms is étale. The base extension of an étale morphism is étale. Proof. Indeed, (i) is trivial, and for (ii) and (iii) it suffices to note that it is true for “unramified” and “flat”. As a matter of fact, there are also corresponding comments to make about local homomorphisms (without the finiteness condition), which in any case should appear in the multiplodoque (starting with the case of unramified). [Trans.] Grothendieck’s multiplodoque d’algèbre homologique was the final version of his Tohoku paper — see (2.1) in `Life and work of Alexander Grothendieck’ by Ching-Li Chan and Frans Oort for more information. (#cor:I.4.7) The cartesian product of two étale morphisms is étale. (#cor:I.4.8) Let X and X' be of finite type over Y, and g\\colon X\\to X' a Y-morphism. If X' is unramified over Y and X is étale over Y, then g is étale. Proof. Indeed, g is the composition of the graph morphism \\Gamma_g\\colon X\\to X\\times_Y X' (which is an open immersion by 3.4 and the projection morphism, which is étale since it is just a “change of base” by X'\\to Y of the étale morphism X\\to Y. (#def:I.4.9) We say that a cover of Y is étale (resp. unramified) if it is a Y-scheme X that is finite over Y and étale (resp. unramified) over Y. The first condition means that X is defined by a coherent sheaf of algebras {\\mathscr{B}} over Y. The second means that {\\mathscr{B}} is locally free over Y (resp. means absolutely nothing) and, further, that, for all y\\in Y, the fibre {\\mathscr{B}}(y)={\\mathscr{B}}_y\\otimes_{{\\mathcal{O}}_y}k(y) is a separable algebra (i.e. a finite composition of finite separable extensions) over k(y). (#prp:I.4.10) Let X be a flat cover of Y of degree n (the definition of this term deserved to figure in 4.9) defined by a locally free coherent sheaf {\\mathscr{B}} of algebras. We define, as usual, the trace homomorphism {\\mathscr{B}}\\to{\\mathscr{A}} (that is a homomorphism of {\\mathscr{A}}-modules, where {\\mathscr{A}}={\\mathcal{O}}_Y). For X to be étale it is necessary and sufficient that the corresponding bilinear form \\operatorname{tr}_{{\\mathscr{B}}/{\\mathscr{A}}}xy define an isomorphism of {\\mathscr{B}} over {\\mathscr{B}}, or, equivalently, that the discriminant section d_{X/Y} = d_{{\\mathscr{B}}/{\\mathscr{A}}} \\in \\Gamma\\big(Y,\\wedge^n\\check{{\\mathscr{B}}}\\otimes_{\\mathscr{A}}\\wedge^n\\check{{\\mathscr{B}}}\\big) is invertible, or that the discriminant ideal defined by this section is the unit ring. Proof. We can reduce to the case where Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(k), and then it is a well-known criterion of separability, and thus trivial by passing to the algebraic closure of k. Remark. We will have a less trivial statement to make later on, when we do not suppose a priori that X is flat over Y, but instead require some normality hypothesis. 5. Fundamental property of étale morphisms (#thm:I.5.1) Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism of finite type. For f to be an open immersion, it is necessary and sufficient for it to be an étale and radicial morphism. Proof. Recall what “radicial” means: injective, with radicial residual extensions (and we also recall that it means that the morphism remains injective for any base extension). The necessity is trivial, and the sufficiency remains to be shown. We are going to give two different proofs: the first is shorter, the second is more elementary. A flat morphism is open, and so we can suppose (by replacing Y with f(X)) that f is an onto homeomorphism. For any base extension, it remains true that f is flat, radicial, surjective, thus a homeomorphism, and a fortiori closed. Thus f is proper. Thus f is finite (reference: Chevalley’s theorem), defined by a coherent sheaf {\\mathscr{B}} of algebras. Now {\\mathscr{B}} is locally free, and further, by hypothesis, of rank~1 everywhere, and so X=Y. We can suppose that Y and X are affine. We can further easily reduce to proving the following: if Y=\\operatorname{Spec}(A), with A local, and if f^{-1}(y) is non-empty (where y is the closed point of Y), then X=Y (indeed, this would imply that every y\\in f(X) has an open neighbourhood U such that X|U=U). We will then have that X=\\operatorname{Spec}(B), and wish to prove that A=B. But, for this, we can reduce to proving the analogous claim where we replace A by \\widehat{A}, and B by B\\otimes_A\\widehat{A} (taking into account the fact that \\widehat{A} is faithfully flat over A). We can thus suppose that A is complete. Let x be the point over y. By 2.2, {\\mathcal{O}}_x is finite over A, and is thus (being flat and radicial over A) identical to A. So X=Y\\coprod X' (disjoint sum). But since X is radicial over Y, X' is empty. (#cor:I.5.2) Let f\\colon X\\to Y be a morphism that is both a closed immersion and étale. If X is connected, then f is an isomorphism from X to a connected component of Y. Proof. Indeed, f is also an open immersion. We thus deduce: (#cor:I.5.3) Let X be an unramified Y-scheme, with Y connected. Then every section of X over Y is an isomorphism from Y to a connected component of X. There is thus a bijective correspondence between the set of such sections and the set of connected components X_i of X such that the projection X_i\\to Y is an isomorphism (or, equivalently, by 5.1, surjective and radicial). In particular, a section is determined by its value at a point. Proof. Only the first claim demands a proof; by 5.2, it suffices to note that a section is a closed immersion (since X is separated over Y) and also étale, by 4.8. ::: {corollary #I.5.4} Let X and Y be preschemes over S, with X unramified and separated over S, and Y connected. Let f and g be S-morphisms from Y to X, and suppose that y is a point of Y such that f(y)=g(y)=x, and such that the residue homomorphisms k(x)\\to k(y) defined by f and g are identical (“f and g agree geometrically at y”). Then f and g are identical. ::: Proof. This follows from 5.3 by reducing to the case where Y=S, and by replacing X with X\\times_S Y. Here is a particularly important variant of 5.3: (#thm:I.5.5) Let S be a prescheme, and let X and Y be S-preschemes. Let S_0 be a closed sub-prescheme of S having the same underlying space as S, and let X_0=X\\times_S S_0 and Y_0=Y\\times_S S_0 be the “restrictions” of X and Y to S_0. Suppose that X is étale over S. Then the natural map \\operatorname{Hom}_S(Y,X) \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{S_0}(X_0,Y_0) is bijective. Proof. We can again reduce to the case where Y=S, and then this follows from the “topological” description of sections of X/Y given in 5.3. Remark (Scholium). This result contains a claim of uniqueness and of existence of morphisms. It can also be expressed (if X and Y are both étale over S) by saying that the functor X\\mapsto X_0 from the category of étale S-schemes to the category of étale S_0-schemes is fully faithful, i.e. establishes an equivalence between the first and a full subcategory of the second. We will see below that it is in fact an equivalence between the first and the second (which will be a theorem of existence for étale S-schemes). The following form (which appears to be more general) of 5.5 is often useful: (#cor:I.5.6) (Extension of coverings) Consider a commutative diagram of morphisms \\begin{CD} X @&lt;&lt;&lt; Y_0 \\\\@VVV @VVV \\\\S @&lt;&lt;&lt; Y \\end{CD} where X\\to S is étale, and Y_0\\to Y is a bijective closed immersion. Then we can find a unique morphism Y\\to X such that the two corresponding triangles commute. Proof. By replacing S with Y, and X with X\\times_S Y, we can reduce to the case where Y=S, and this is then a particular case of 5.5 for Y=S. We also note the following immediate consequence of 5.1 (which we did not give as a corollary, in order to not interrupt the line of ideas developed following 5.1: (#prp:I.5.7) Let X and X' be preschemes that are of finite type and flat over Y, and let g\\colon X\\to X' be a Y-morphism. For g to be an open immersion (resp. an isomorphism), it is necessary and sufficient for the induced morphism on the fibres g\\otimes_Y k(y)\\colon X\\otimes_Y k(y) \\to X'\\otimes_Y k(y) to be an open immersion (resp. an isomorphism) for all y\\in Y. Proof. It suffices to prove sufficiency; since it is true for the property of being a surjection, we can reduce to the case of an open immersion. By 5.1, we have to show that g is radicial (which is trivial) and étale (which follows from 5.9 below). (#cor:I.5.8) Let X and X' be Y-preschemes, g\\colon X\\to X' a Y-morphism, x a point of X, and y the projection of x in Y. For g to be quasi-finite (resp. unramified) at x, it is necessary and sufficient for g\\otimes_Y k(y) to be so. Proof. The two algebras over k(g(x)) that we have to study in order to see whether or not we do indeed have a morphism which is quasi-finite (resp. unramified) at x are the same for g and g\\otimes_Y k(y). (#cor:I.5.9) With the notation of 5.8, suppose that X and X' are flat and of finite type over Y. For g to be flat (resp. étale) at x, it is necessary and sufficient for g\\otimes_Y k(y) to be so. Proof. For “flat”, the statement only serves as a reminder, since this is one of the fundamental criteria of flatness6. For “étale”, this follows by taking 5.8 into account. 6. Application to étale extensions of complete local rings This section is a particular case of the results on formal preschemes, which should appear in the multiplodoque. Nevertheless, here we get away without much difficulty, i.e. without the explicit local determination of the étale morphisms in §7 (using the Main Theorem). This is perhaps sufficient reason to keep this current section (even in the multiplodoque) where it is. (#thm:I.6.1) Let A be a complete local ring (Noetherian, of course), with residue field k. For any A-algebra B, let R(B)=B\\otimes_Ak be thought of as a k-algebra; this depends functorially on B. Then R defines an equivalence between the category of A-algebras that are finite and étale over A and the category of algebras that are finite rank and separable over k. Firstly, the functor in question is fully faithful, as follows from the more general fact: (#cor:I.6.2) Let B and B' be A-algebras that are finite over A. If B is étale over A, then the canonical map \\operatorname{Hom}_{A\\mathsf{-alg}}(B,B') \\to \\operatorname{Hom}_{k\\mathsf{-alg}}(R(B),R(B')) is bijective. Proof. We can reduce to the case where A is Artinian (by replacing A by A/{\\mathfrak{m}}^n), and then this is a particular case of 5.5. It remains to prove that, for every finite and separable k algebra (or we can simply say “étale”, for brevity) L, there exists some B étale over A such that R(B) is isomorphic to L. We can suppose that L is a separable extension of k, and, as such, it admits a generator x, i.e. it is isomorphic to an algebra k[t]/Fk[t], where F\\in k[t] is a monic polynomial. We can lift F to a monic polynomial F_1 in A[t], and we take B=A[t]/F_1A[t]. cf. EGA IV 16.3.↩︎ In EGA II 6.2.3 we further suppose that f is of finite type.↩︎ cf. regrets in III~1.2.↩︎ cf. IV.↩︎ cf. regrets in III 1.2.↩︎ cf. IV.5.9↩︎ "]]
